Reasons why you should use livedata?
1.livedata ensures your UI matches your data state
	Live data follows the observer pattern.
	livedata notifies observer when the lifecycle state changes.
2.you won't get memory  leaks
	observers are bound to lifecycle objects
	lifecycle objects are cleaned up after their associated lifecycle is detroyed.
3.No crashes due to stopped activities.
	if the observer is lifecycle is inactive such as in the case of an activity in the backstack then it doesn't receive any livedata events

4.No more manual lifecycle handling
	UI component just observe relevant data and don't stop or resume observation.

	Livedata automatically manages all of this since it's aware of the relevant lifecycle status changes while observing.

5.Your data is always up to data.
	what happens if a lifecycle becomes inactive?
	if would receive the latest data upon becoming active again.
6.proper configuration changes.
	onconfiguration changes like device rotation immediately latest avaliable data is receiived.
	prevents redundant requests to network or db.
