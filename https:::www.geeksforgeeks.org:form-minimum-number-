Given a string like ‘UUUDULR’, need to derive the final coordinates starting from (0, 0). This is pretty easy and he is asked to add a few other test cases if I would like to. Not much to add as it is not having any corner cases.

Given a dictionary of the words(strings) which contains different words & you are given an input string e.g. “abd”. You need to find the largest word available in the supplied dictionary which can be made using the letters of input string. The returned word can contain only the same no of occurrences of the letters as given in the input string i.e. if a letter is given once then in the output it should be existed only once. Examples:
