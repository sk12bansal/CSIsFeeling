Publisher Subscriber

1) Decouples a system's services.
2) Easily add subscribers and publishers without informing the other.
3) Converts multiple points of failure to single point of failure.
4) Interaction logic can be moved to services/ message broker.

Disadvantages:
1) An extra layer of interaction slows services
2) Cannot be used in systems requiring strong consistency of data
3) Additional cost to team for redesigning, learning and maintaining the message queues.
